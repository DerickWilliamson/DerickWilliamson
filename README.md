This is a culmunation of the talents, skills, projects and other items I have worked on, am working on, and adjusting to. A physical demonstration and clarification of what skills I posess and what I can do for you and bring to the table.

## Roadmap
So right now we are extremely early in this series of projects. What I plan to do in the near future in addition to my course work is as follows:
Step One: Learn how to integrate all of the projects onto a single page seperated by only a link.
Step Two: I want to improve on and make a susequent Pac Man project in addition that follows a series of clicks on the page. In previous content we learned how to add dots to a page by clicking. I want to expand the pacman array to include up and down and then I want to update the location to follow the dots eating the dots as it where. 

That is what I am currently planning. Checkback for updates, timelines and more.
