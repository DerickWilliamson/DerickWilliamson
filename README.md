As of right now this segment is just afew projects (this will be updated as the projects grow.)
the page and the front end portion.

## Roadmap
So right now we are extremely early in this series of projects. What I plan to do in the near future in addition to my course work is as follows:
These updates are specific to the front end portion. To view future plans and updates to individual projects please click on said project.
First I want to test it on other operating systems and mobile devices in particular make sure my latency stays low as the number of projects increase and the scope grows.
Next I want to integrate all the external links into internal links that update onto the page itself without requiring an additional load time. My issue and hesitation with this is latency.
I plan to integrate a custom load bar that fills percentage off of percentage of projects viewed. While the initial scope of this is easy enough I am having a couple issues with a good way to matain the information from previous views without using cookies a log in or drastically affecting latency. I really am enthusiastic about the idea though so I will figure it out.
